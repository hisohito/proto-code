This is my diploma project in Altay State Technical University.

This system can help you to create and improve architecture of your application.
With using of developed language PROTO you can describe all the principles of your application design and then check it with one of avaliable in system verification tool (such as SPIN). System also creates view of described application on selected automata language (for further usage with various verificators).
You can easily describe your application on PROTO language using basic code editor created as simple Eclipse plugin.

Key words:
        Finite automata, Model Checking, verification, SPIN, Promela, prototype, DSL, ANTLR, XTEXT, AST, CFG
